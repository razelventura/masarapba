Welcome to Masarap Ba! 

"Masarap ba?" is Filipino for "Is it delicious?"

Have you ever been to a restaurant for a second or nth time and can't remember what you've liked from your previous visit/s? 
This app is for you. You can log the food that you ordered and decide if it's masarap (delicious) or not. 
Then next time you visit that restaurant, you'd know what to order again and what to avoid!

May your food always be MASARAP! Enjoy!
