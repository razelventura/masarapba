Brief: An explanation of the thinking process / considerations / installations needed for the Masarap Ba app.  

## PURPOSE 

"Masarap ba?" is Filipino for "Is it delicious?"

Have you ever been to a restaurant for a second or nth time and can't remember what you've liked from your previous visit/s? 
This app is for you. You can log the food that you ordered and decide if it's masarap (delicious) or not. Then next time you visit that restaurant, you'd know what to order again and what to avoid!

## INSTALLATIONS

``` npx expo install expo-splash-screen ```
``` npm install react-native-safe-area-context@4.8.2 ```
``` npm install react-native-screens@~3.29.0 ```

 

## NOTE TO STEPHEN
This was only tested on iOS.
